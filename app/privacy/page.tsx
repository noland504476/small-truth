Why this works
Matches the emotional temperature of the site

Feels finished without feeling corporate

Builds trust quietly

No promises you can’t keep

Next, when you’re ready:

Light styling pass (same fonts, softer spacing)

Optional footer link styling

Decide whether About/Privacy appear anywhere else (they don’t need to)

This is exactly the right level.
